You've created your first [Robin PRO](https://apps.shopify.com/robin-pro-image-gallery)
gallery and uploaded some images. Great!

This article will show you how to display it anywhere on your site. There are
two ways to do this and both of them are really simple.

### Option A: Code snippet

Don't worry, there is absolutely no coding involved. All you need to do is:

#### Step 1

Copy the code snippet.

<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="Copy Robin PRO gallery code snippet"
   href="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/copy_snippet.gif">
<img src="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/copy_snippet.gif" class="post-image">
</a>

#### Step 2

Paste it into the **HTML content** of your page.

<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="Paste Robin PRO gallery code snippet"
   href="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/paste_snippet.gif">
<img src="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/paste_snippet.gif" class="post-image">
</a>

Please make sure you're pasting the code snippet into the HTML content of your
page. Your gallery won't load if you paste it as simple text.

You'll see that **pages**, **products**, and **collections** all have descriptions
that support HTML. This allows you to display your galleries in any of them.

### Option B: Sections

If your Shopify theme supports sections,
[Robin PRO](https://apps.shopify.com/robin-pro-image-gallery) will create its own
section where you can select which gallery you want to insert into your page.

<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="Adding Robin PRO gallery section"
   href="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/section.gif">
<img src="/posts/how-to-embed-robin-pro-galleries/section.gif" class="post-image">
</a>

Sections make it easy to add the section once and add multiple galleries to it.
In order to add more galleries to your section, click _Add Gallery_.
