Christmas came early this year for Shopify developers. If you're not a Shopify developer or missed the news,
as of August 1, 2021, Shopify is offering 0% revenue share on the first million dollars your apps make annually
on the Shopify App Store (previously 20%).

In case you haven't applied yet, go for it. Takes a few seconds and you'll likely be approved within minutes.

If August was kind to you and your app business, my ask and the message of this post is simple:

> Use the extra money you made from 0% revenue share to help a good cause of your choice.
> [Share your story](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShopifyDevsPayItForward?src=hashtag_click) to inspire others!

Thank you, Shopify, for making this possible.

Opportunities to help are endless. Especially now. Let's do this, Shopify Devs ðŸ‘«

### How we're helping

I'm using some of my August revenues to support [Bangkok Community Help Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/BkkCommunityHelp).
They're working tirelessly helping local communities that need it the most.

This month, I'll also be tipping food delivery drivers about 5x more than I normally would.
Such a simple and inexpensive way to brighten someone's day.
