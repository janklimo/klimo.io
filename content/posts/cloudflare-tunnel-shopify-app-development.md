If you've worked on a Shopify app before, chances are you've used tunneling for local development.
Historically, Shopify has been [recommending](https://workshops.shopify.dev/workshops/getting-started-apps#0) ngrok across
their docs and it's still the go-to tool for most developers.

I've been using paid version of ngrok mainly in order to configure custom URLs for my tunnels to
keep my configuration consistent. Using the following config, I'd route traffic to my web server and webpack
dev server.

```yaml
authtoken: <token>
tunnels:
  robin-pro:
    proto: http
    addr: 3000
    subdomain: robin-pro
    bind_tls: true
  robin-pro-wds:
    proto: http
    addr: 3035
    subdomain: robin-pro-wds
    bind_tls: true
    host-header: localhost:3035
```

With the launch of [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), you no longer need to pay to
configure custom domains. I've been using it for a few months now and the DX has been excellent. This post shows you how to
use it when developing your own Shopify apps.

I'll be using my Ruby on Rails app as an example in this article but, clearly, you'll be able to use Cloudflare Tunnel
with any tech stack.

> My app is currently using `webpacker`. I'll update this article as I migrate to Vite and start using Shopify CLI
> together with app extensions.

## Setting up Cloudflare Tunnel

Note that while it's possible to run [quick tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/)
without your own domain, I'll assume you have a domain set up in Cloudflare dashboard. The config is simple,
you can learn more about it [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).

The first thing we'll do is install `cloudflared` â€“ a CLI tool we'll use to run and configure our tunnel.

```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Then we'll need to authenticate the client to continue configuring our tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This will open your browser, listing your available domains:

![authorize Cloudflare Tunnel](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/authorize.png)

I'll be working with `robinpro.gallery` so I'll click on that. Select the one you'll be using for your tunnel.

![authorize Cloudflare Tunnel prompt](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/authorize-confirm.png)

Click _Authorize_ and you should see a confirmation if everything went well.

![authorize Cloudflare Tunnel success](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/authorize-success.png)

This will copy the issued certificate to your machine, which would be `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` by default,
letting you use `cloudflared` to communicate with Cloudflare. Try running the following as a test:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel list
```

It won't return any tunnels for now. Let's create one. We'll call it _demo_:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create demo
```

This creates the tunnel and saves configuration JSON file in your local `~/.cloudflared` directory.

If you open your [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) dashboard, you will see the tunnel listed
as Inactive. You'll also see a little hint telling you the tunnel is locally managed.

![inactive tunnel in your Zero Trust dashboard](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/tunnel-zero-trust.png)

We can easily migrate the newly-created tunnel to be managed by the Zero Trust dashboard. This makes the
process more visual and easier to understand so I'll use this approach, rather than going back to the CLI.

Click on the tunnel name, click _Configure_.

![tunnel configure](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/tunnel-configure.png)

You'll see the following screen. No need to worry about the warnings since this is a brand new tunnel
without any preconfigured ingress rules.

![tunnel migrate](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/tunnel-migrate.png)

The only thing we need to do is run the tunnel, as requested above.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run demo
```

This will enable the _Start migration_ button. You can click it now.

You can hit confirm on all 4 confirmation steps without any changes and
finally click _Migrate tunnel_.

![tunnel confirm migration](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/tunnel-migrate.gif)

Our new tunnel should now show up as _Healthy_. Looking good!

![tunnel healthy](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/tunnel-healthy.png)

### Public hostnames

Click on the tunnel name to enter configuration. Under the _Public Hostname_ we'll click
_Add a public hostname_. Public hostnames will be public URLs we can use to forward
traffic to our local machine.

![new public hostname for this tunnel](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/new-public-hostname.png)

Just like you can see in my old ngrok config above, I'll be adding two public hostnames.
One for my Rails web server:

![new public hostname for web server](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/demo-server.png)

And another one for my Webpack dev server to facilitate HMR:

![new public hostname for client](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/demo-client.png)

If you go back to your Cloudflare dashboard and check your domain's DNS records, you
will see these two were added automatically to make tunneling possible:

![dns records](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/dns-records.png)

> At the time of writing, these records are not being removed when the tunnel is deleted
> so you'll need to remove them manually should you decide to delete a tunnel and clean all
> associated records.

Our tunnel configuration is ready! We'll need to update a few other things before
we can start local development.

## App setup

We'll need to update `webpacker.yml` config to point to the new public hostname we've
created above:

```yml
development:
  <<: *default

  dev_server:
    https: false
    host: localhost
    port: 3035
    public: demo-client.robinpro.gallery
    hmr: true
```

You'll also need to add the public hostname of your web server to your hosts
config in `development.rb`:

```ruby
config.hosts << 'demo-server.robinpro.gallery'
```

## Shopify app setup

Under your Shopify Partners dashboard, configure your development app to use the new
public hostname:

![Shopify app configure URLs](/posts/cloudflare-tunnel/shopify-app-config.png)

## S3 setup

If you're using S3 or other remote storage, you'll need to update its CORS configuration.
Here's my S3 config:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Authorization",
      "x-amz-date",
      "x-amz-content-sha256",
      "content-type"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://demo-server.robinpro.gallery"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  },
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

And that's it! Now as long as you have your app running locally, all you need to do is run:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run demo
```

Happy building!
