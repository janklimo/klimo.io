## Why You'll Love Robin PRO Image Gallery

Image gallery app built for 2019
Fast, mobile-first, beautiful. Create a great first impression that converts into sales!

### Faster store, more sales

Robin PRO doesn't make your store slower. In fact, you'll make your store load much faster by moving your product images to Robin PRO. Unlike other apps, Robin PRO quietly works in the background and lets your store fully load before it renders your galleries.

### Flexible

Choose between grid or masonry gallery layouts. Easily customize all parameters.

### Instant image delivery

Fast content delivery network (CDN) - the same one used by the likes of reddit or Product Hunt. Your visitors will download your images from a server nearest to where they currently are. It doesn't get faster than that!

### Smart image optimization

Robin PRO automatically compresses and optimizes your images. They will be delivered without loss of quality, in the right size, in stunning colors.

### Safe

Dynamically apply watermarks to your images to protect them from theft.

### Mobile-friendly

Enjoy the most advanced mobile support available. Horizontal swipe to browse images, spread to zoom in. Vertical swipe or pinch to close gallery.

### Beautiful

Robust and beautiful Lightbox engine with pixel-perfect vector icons. You'll love the zoom button (see the image in full resolution), as well as native full-screen mode.

### Smart

Smart thumbnails (if your image shows a person, the thumbnail will show their face, not a random cut-out from the image) and smart image loading (Lightbox loads neighboring images based on user movement - never more than it needs).

### Fun to use

Admin interface that is a pure delight to work with. Robin PRO is proudly built with Shopify's Polaris framework. Upload your images in bulk, configure anything with one click. Add your galleries to any page with one line of code. Every interaction is instantaneous, no page reloads. Ever.

### Fast setup

Let us migrate your galleries from other apps. Your visitors will get better experience with no extra effort for you.

### Fully compatible

Works on any browser, computer, or mobile device. Avoid embarrassing situations when your store breaks for certain customers.

### SEO-friendly

Images use captions as alt tags to help your store rank better in Google.

### Pixel-perfect

Crafted using the latest technologies used by Facebook and others. We're constantly adding new features, so that you keep getting more value out of it for the same price.

### Why Robin?

Robins are fast, nimble creatures, delighting people with their beauty. I've developed Robin PRO from the ground up around these principles.

## Changelog

#### Nov 23, 2019

When opening a gallery on a mobile device, users are presented with a quick
reminder letting them know they can navigate between gallery images
by swiping left and right.

#### Nov 5, 2019

Compact view galleries now show a _Reset_ button to quickly minimize the expanded
gallery back to the initial two rows of images.

  <img src="/shopify-apps/robin-pro/reset.png" class="app__thumbnail">
</a>

#### Nov 4, 2019

Thanks to smart caching, galleries are now returned and rendered up to 2x faster!

   href="/shopify-apps/robin-pro/caching.png">
  <img src="/shopify-apps/robin-pro/caching.png" class="app__thumbnail">
</a>

#### Oct 29, 2019

App CSS style definitions are now strictly scoped. This is to prevent conflicts in rare
cases when parent Shopify theme also uses Photoswipe to render its images.

#### Oct 8, 2019

Optimized the way the list of your galleries is loaded so that they're only
fetched once. This saves you time when you're returning back from the gallery view
to the galleries list view.

#### Oct 5, 2019

The same gallery can now be displayed on the same page as many times as you need.
Fixed a sneaky bug that would only permit the first instance of a gallery to
be rendered.

#### Oct 2, 2019

Image uploads are now multipart. This means they can be conveniently paused
and resumed at any time.

<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="multipart image gallery uploads"
   href="/shopify-apps/robin-pro/multipart.gif">
<img src="/shopify-apps/robin-pro/multipart.gif" class="app__thumbnail">
</a>

This is especially useful when an upload fails. When you retry, you'll resume
the previous upload. You'll never have to re-upload the whole file from scratch
again.

#### Sep 24, 2019

Responsive images for retina screens. The app now uses `srcset` to render
high-resolution images on devices that support them.

<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="responsive images retina before"
   href="https://robin-pro-preview.imgix.net/portfolio/before_gallery.png">
<img src="https://robin-pro-preview.imgix.net/portfolio/before_gallery.png?w=250&h=250&crop=faces&fit=crop" class="app__thumbnail">
</a>
<a class="app__thumbnail--link" alt="responsive images retina after"
   href="https://robin-pro-preview.imgix.net/portfolio/after_gallery.png">
<img src="https://robin-pro-preview.imgix.net/portfolio/after_gallery.png?w=250&h=250&crop=faces&fit=crop" class="app__thumbnail">
</a>

This is critical for delivering a great user experience on mobile devices. The
latest iPhones, as well as most high-end Android devices require images in 3x the
resolution to deliver a sharp-looking image.

#### Sep 13, 2019

Fixed gallery style definitions to make them immune from being overridden by theme styles.

#### Sep 9, 2019

Gallery image thumbnails now come with on-hover overlays. These display image
caption (if provided) or show an icon as a fallback.
