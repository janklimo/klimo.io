      <description>Recently we&amp;rsquo;ve been making a more conscious effort to improve the quality of our seed data.
Firstly, to make it easier to onboard new team members. Secondly, to make the app ready for Review Apps. Certainly, it&amp;rsquo;s a great thing to be able to just re-seed your database if your local experiments go awry ðŸ˜…
The kind of seeds I&amp;rsquo;ve seen over the years typically neglect images. They either use a minimal placeholder, use a few nicer images that are repeated over and over and checked into source control, or don&amp;rsquo;t do anything at all.</description>

      <description>One of the most useful features I&amp;rsquo;d love to see Shopify add to the Partners portal is a chart of your MRR (monthly recurring revenue).
This answers a simple question of What is the current value of all of my active recurring charges? In other words, how much money will you receive in the next 30 days?
There is one problem with the Earnings chart:
It&amp;rsquo;s a lagging indicator showing you the last 30 days.</description>

      <description>This article shows you how to use AWS CLI programmatically to automate your deployment process. We&amp;rsquo;ll upload assets to S3 (specifying their ACL and caching behavior) and invalidate CloudFront cache. Starting with a local shell script, we conclude with plugging the script into our CircleCI workflow. It may be especially useful if you&amp;rsquo;re using Rails with Webpacker, but no experience with Rails is required.
